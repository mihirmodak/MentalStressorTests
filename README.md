# Stress Test GUI Documentation

## Description

This GUI is intended to be used to conduct cognitive stress tests. The GUI contains some cognitive stress tasks designed
 to induce stress in a subject performing that task.

The GUI was developed in Python using the Tkinter library, and was exported to an executable file using the PyInstaller 
tool.

## Installation

There is no insaller needed for this program. The executable `.exe` file is located in the `dist` folder. The test data from the GUI is saved in a `saves` folder located within the same `dist` folder. 

To use the program, you can either download the code as a .zip file (using the green button above) or run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mihirmodak/stress_test.git
```
from the command line to copy all the code files to your computer. You will need to have `git` installed for the latter option to work.
